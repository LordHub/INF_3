Example n= 5 p=3 number of processes
The number of rows-> Block size mb = 5/3 = 2 (rounding up)
two blocks of two and one of one line, it adds a ficticious row at the to make the block size a multiple.
Once that is done we use a MPI_Scatter, it≈õ necessary that all the blocks have the same number of rows

Original distribution:
A is distributed by blocks of rows, using MPI Scatter.
-ppdMat: whole matrix, only in proc. 0
- ppdMatLcl: local matrix
- nBloque: block size
- fictitious rows are added to make the number of rows a
- multiple of the number of procs.
b is replicated in all the procs, using MPI Bcast.

nRellenaMat generates the matrix
pdGenTI generates vector B
TO distribute A MPI_Bcast at the end, in vector pdX
