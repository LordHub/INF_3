 CYCLIC DISTRIBUTION WITH MPI   
---------------------------------

Example n= 5 p=3 number of processes
The number of rows-> Block size mb = 5/3 = 2 (rounding up)
two blocks of two and one of one line, it adds a ficticious row at the to make the block size a multiple.
Once that is done we use a MPI_Scatter, itÅ› necessary that all the blocks have the same number of rows

Original distribution:
A is distributed by blocks of rows, using MPI Scatter.
-ppdMat: whole matrix, only in proc. 0
- ppdMatLcl: local matrix
- nBloque: block size
- fictitious rows are added to make the number of rows a
- multiple of the number of procs.
b is replicated in all the procs, using MPI Bcast.

nRellenaMat generates the matrix
pdGenTI generates vector B
TO distribute A MPI_Bcast at the end, in vector pdX

We need to do a new distribution:
From p0 p0 p1 p1 p2 p2 to ->>  p0 p1 p2 p0 p1 p2

We need to now, for each row i:
The process where it goes (owner)
The row index in the local matrix (local index)

We need to do a Bcast to tell all the processses where they go 
each iteration does all  rows, but only modifies the row it has assigned, broadcast row K

to be able to implement this program we need to know:
-The Owner
-The local index

ifs- i/mb  the index of the owner
index row i -> i mod blocksize (i mod mb)


row index | owner | local index |       n= 6 p=3
 0           0         0 
 1           1         0
 2           2         0
 3           0         1
 4           1         1
 5           2         1
